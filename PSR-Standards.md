# Code Formating Standards

## PSR-1

About four years ago I decided that I wanted my PHP code to follow a uniform standard. A quick search on the internet showed that there weren't any clearly defined standards at www.php.net. The only standards I was able to find were at https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/. Lacking any other options I adopted these standards. 

The main changes this produced were bracket placement on function declarations. I'm personally not a fan of how the PSR opts to drop them down below the function name, and this differs from most of the code I see developed within the WordPress community. However, in my effort to become standardized I adopted these changes. 

When working with a team, I always opt to use whatever code formatting (code standards) that the team has adopted.
