# Brian Peterson's Website Portfolio

All websites are fully responsive across mobile, tablet and desktop devices and integrated into Google Analytics.

## Nebi StarTrader
### [https://nebistartrader.com](https://nebistartrader.com)
This is a WordPress site using WooCommerce to sell Zoom meetings. A designer provided a FIGMA mock-up that I skinned to the site. I then added improvements to the design - animated buttons, additional hover effects, and at the site owner's request a glowing trail to follow the cursor (desktop only). A lot of custom WooCommerce programming, and template design were developed to fulfill the Figma design requirements.

## Oregon Gutter Service
### [https://oregongutterservice.com](https://oregongutterservice.com)
This is a WordPress site with a lot of custom developed features for their office staff. The site owner wanted simple front-end forms for uploading testimonials and managing their image galleries. I created these front-end forms to work with installed plugins. A great deal of work went into increasing their SERP through organic SEO best practices, getting 5 star Google reviews, A/B testing, and analyzing Google Analytics data from Google Tag manager as well as Google Adds. The site additionally has a fast loading accelerated mobile pages (AMP) version [https://oregongutterservice.com/amp/](https://oregongutterservice.com/amp/) My only concern with the site is that it does not load as quickly as I would like but they are not interested in pursuing further CDN caching and programming to optimize this.

## Hawaii Ocean Sports
### [https://hawaiioceansports.com](https://hawaiioceansports.com)
This is a WordPress site I designed and developed around their logo colors. I am proud of the design. They may have changed some of the top hero images/slideshow images, but other than that it still looks good. The site also incorporates a third party booking system for their boat cruise rentals. Again the site loads slower then I like but they are unwilling to spring for a better server (the site is hosted on a low-end shared hosting platform).

## Kismet Design
### [https://kismetwebdesign.com](https://kismetwebdesign.com)
This is my personal website developed solely in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and a little PHP. This was an experiment to see if I could create a website that loads faster than a WordPress site. It turns out to be negligibly faster in page load times than a well optimized WordPress site hosted on a VPS. I also integrated animated SVG graphics.
