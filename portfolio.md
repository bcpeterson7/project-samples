## Dataport - K-12 School District Information Management System

Dataport is an information management system for school districts. The portal is built on top of WordPress, and sits behind a school's firewall. As a bespoke solution for school districts I've developed different modules as needed: 504 plan module, mental health referrals, volunteer management, staff continuing education tracking, library resource rentals, COVID-19 health screening, suicide intervention management, community concerns reporting, restraint and seclusion reporting, and behavioral safety concern reporting. The portals follow the State of Oregon's Student Privacy laws and securely handles information. These portals are on top of Linux LAMP/LEMP stacks, some of which I managed and maintained. Student and staff information is imported nightly from other district CMS/HMIS systems. The demo link shows a very bare-bones install, in regard to available modules.

## Nebi StarTrader
### [https://nbst.kismetwebdevelopment.com](https://nbst.kismetwebdevelopment.com/)
This is the development site for a WordPress site using WooCommerce to sell Zoom meetings. The live site is no longer maintained by the owner. A designer provided a FIGMA mock-up that I skinned exactly to the site. I then added improvements to the design - animated buttons, additional hover effects, and at the site owner's request a glowing trail to follow the cursor (desktop only). The homepage hero video was edited by me to loop (it previously ended by pausing on a the text, "SEO & Marketing") and encoded to be a much smaller file-size for faster loading.  A lot of custom WooCommerce programming, and template design were developed to fulfill the Figma design requirements.

## Angels Sitter Services
### [https://angelssitterservice.com](https://angelssitterservice.com)
During my time at Oyova I completed many websites and app development projects. For this site, I was solely responsible for the complete design and development of the site, with feedback from my supervisor on colors and images. This WordPress site is a basic 4 page information site with an employee training and quiz section available only to approved users. This site uses the WP Bakery page builder.

## Koffler Boats
### [https://kofflerboats.com](https://kofflerboats.com)
Koffler Boats produces a wide variety of boating craft for anglers. Traffic through this WordPress site has caused the company to triple in employees. The boat inventory is a custom post type, with a custom template. The site also features a custom drag and drop image gallery on some “build” pages. Additionally, the boat feature pages utilize slick.js to display modal galleries of the various features a customer can order. Organic SEO optimization, with A/B testing, has greatly increased site traffic.

## Oregon Gutter Service
### [https://oregongutterservice.com](https://oregongutterservice.com)
This is a WordPress site with a lot of custom developed features for their office staff. The site owner wanted simple front-end forms for uploading testimonials and managing their image galleries. I created these front-end forms to work with installed plugins. A great deal of work went into increasing their SERP through organic SEO best practices, getting 5 star Google reviews, A/B testing, and analyzing Google Analytics data from Google Tag manager as well as Google Ads. The site additionally has been optimized for fast loading with accelerated mobile pages (AMP) - [https://oregongutterservice.com/amp/](https://oregongutterservice.com/amp/). 

## Hawaii Ocean Sports
### [https://hawaiioceansports.com](https://hawaiioceansports.com)
This is a WordPress site I designed and developed around their logo colors. I am proud of the design. They may have changed some of the top hero images/slideshow images, but other than that it still looks good. The site also incorporates a third party booking system via JavaScript embed for their boat cruise rentals. The site loads slower then I like but they are unwilling to spring for a better server (the site is hosted on GoDaddy's low-end shared hosting platform).

## Kismet Design
### [https://kismetwebdesign.com](https://kismetwebdesign.com)
This is my personal website developed solely in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and a little PHP. This was an experiment to see if I could create a website that loads faster than a WordPress site. It turns out to be negligibly faster in page load times than a well optimized WordPress site hosted on a VPS or managed platform like WP Engine with the WP Rocket caching plugin. I also integrated animated SVG graphics.

## EMS Repair
### [https://emsrepair.com](https://emsrepair.com/)
After creating their SEO optimized website, EMS Repair had to hire more staff as their business tripled in income. The site design is now 8+ years old and in need of refreshing as modern standards are for full-width layouts with better UI/UX controls. EMS Repair also features a custom staff portal where technicians can make vehicle inspection entries. The portal features a JS script I developed to use a tablet's, or phone's, rear facing camera to take pictures of items needing repair. Additionally, form entries are converted to PDF for email to their customer’s corporate headquarters.
